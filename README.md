## **UX (User Experience)** ## 

### **Project Goals** ### 

The goal for this project is to provide an easy to navigate platform that caters specifically for older users who may have lower computer literacy.  Helping individuals who may be new to technology to stay connect with love one through its useful video tutorials and links to useful platforms and information. 

### **User Goals** ### 

* A central location to find information on 
* Covid-19 health information 
* Religious ceremonies  
* Communication Platforms 
* Entertainment portals 
* Exercise and fitness information 
* Service to assist people feeling socially isolated  
* To educate user on how to set up accounts and use various communication platforms. 
* Stay connected with family and friends while cocooning at home.  

### **User Story** ### 

* As a user of Cocoon Connect, I want   

    * Easy and intuitive website to navigate. 
    * A central location to find information that is of interest and use to me. 
    * Educate myself on different communication platforms so I can use technology to stay connected with family and friends while cocooning at home.  
    * Be able to access useful information in one central location rather than having to go to multiple different sites and read vast amounts of information on several different pages. 

 

### **Site Owner Goals** ### 

* As a site owner I want to 
* Make it easy for older users to access relevant information in a centralized location 
* I want a visually appealing yet easy to navigate website, so my target demographic finds it easy to use. 
* I want to help inform people how technology can help them stay connected to friends and family during this weird time. 

 

### **User Requirements and Expectations** ### 

**Requirements** 

* To navigate the website using the navbar easily and quickly 
* To be provided with useful information on covid-19 and other information of interest 
* Content displayed in an easy to read and clear manner 
* Information displayed in a concise manner that is easy to digest 
* Easy access to information without having to go to multiple websites and read vast amounts of information 

**Expectations**
* Content is quick to locate and easy to read 
* Navigation is simple to use and intuitive even to those who are not overly tech literate 
* All external links open in a separate tab so they can easily get back to the original site 
* All external links open to the relevant part of the site rather than the home page 

 

### **Design Choices** ### 

When designing this site, I researched how best to design for an older demographic. I wanted to ensure that the website was intuitive to use easy to navigate, had clear text, with good contrast and large clickable areas for ease of use for individuals with reduced dexterity, while still being visually appealing.  
This is most evident in the responsive navbar which maintains a full width clickable area for all screen sizes. With the expanded menu present in large and medium screen sizes and a collapsible button with “menu” text as opposed to a burger icon to ensure the purpose of it is clear even to those that are not overly computer literate.  
I loosely based my website design off the CV project from the course material and adapted it to better suit my target demographic and suit the aesthetic I was trying to achieve.  

 

### **Fonts** ### 

I choose a font that was clear to read as suggest by many of the articles I read when researching web design for an older user. The font I choose was Exo front from Google fonts. To ensure coherent feel throughout the website I used the one font in different weights.  

### **Icons** ### 

I used Icons form Font Awesome add a visual representation of text. I used sparingly and only where appropriate and where I felt they would add value. I struggled to find some appropriate font awesome icons that were appropriate and work in with the version of font awesome that I was using. This is most noticeable on the medical info page as I couldn’t find an icon to represent a sore throat and ended up having to reuse the tissue box.  

 

### **Colors** ### 

The colors I used were inspired by the header image which I found in the [Shutterstock library](https://www.shutterstock.com/)  
I used [a colour picker tool](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/) to get the hex values for the colours from the image. 
For the Website title, footer and menu button, in mobile view I used #547864 
* For the home page titles and nav button I used #7B9AB9 
* For the medical Info nav button, page titles and icons I used #F4ABC7 
* For the social page nav button, and all associated page’s titles and icons I used #8AB69E 
* For useful contacts and resources, nav button, titles and icons I used #F25637 


### **Wireframing** ### 

I started out initially by simply sketching out my wireframes on paper and then used [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc) to complete a soft copy 
Links to my wireframes can be found here: 

 I initially felt I would divide the homepage into multiple different clickable areas that would link to the various pages of the website. However, having completed my wireframing I felt not only did this complicate the homepage, making it more difficult to navigate but it just replicated the navbar and it felt as if I was trying to fill space. Ideally, I did not want to use a collapsible navbar however through wireframing I quickly discovered that to maintain a large clickable area for the navbar it took up too much space on mobile device so decided to use a collapsible navbar for this screen size. 

 
## **Features** ##

### **What didn’t make the cut** ### 

There were a few features and layout choice that I had to make in order to make the site more accessible for its users. 
Initially I wanted to have more elements in the navbar, while it looked ok in the wireframes having made the original navbar with 6 elements (exercise and entertainment as their own sections) I realized that this not only made the navigation of the page more complex but also reduced the clickable area of the nav elements. A large clickable area is a desirable feature for older users due to reduced dexterity. For this reason, I decided to simplify the page and the navbar to four main sections. 
I had also considered including a carousel on the homepage, however I felt that this may make the site too complex. Also, having read some information on carousels I saw that the click through rate on them were low so felt it would not add to the site.  

 

## **Technologies used** ## 

### **Languages** ### 

* HTML 
* CSS 
* JS 

### **Tools & Libraries** ### 

* Git  
* Bootstrap  
* Font-Awesome  
* Google fonts 
 

### **Testing** ###  

First, I checked the HTML using a [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) which said there were no errors. 
Then I used a [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) which except for the web browser extensions errors, seemed to be all good.   
Ideally, I would have liked to test the useability of the site with the target demographic and observed how they interacted with it but unfortunately due to the current restrictions this was not possible. 

### **Responsiveness** ### 

* Implementation  
* I have used bootstrap throughout the project to ensure maximum responsiveness. I tested the site at varying screen sizes using DevTools in Google Chrome 
* Results of testing: 
* Bootstrap ensured that most elements were responsive and acted as expected, except for the navbar. I followed the video tutorial from the course material, for the whiskey drop website, to use JavaScript to make the navbar into a collapsible button for mobile devices. 
* After the initial test I decided that the nav bar was taking up too much space in mobile view if it wasn’t in a collapsible button. I used the whiskey drop tutorial in the course material to add JavaScript to achieve this functionality. 

## **Deployment** ## 

CocoonConnect was developed on GitPod. When deploying the site I followed the instructions as per the GitHub guidelines.  
1. I logged into my Github account. 
2. I selected the repository for CocoonConnect 
3. I selected the setting tabs at the top of the page. 
4. From there I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and the master branch and root file. 
5. I confirmed my selection. 
6. A link to the newly deployed site was then generated.  

 

## **Cloning from GitHub** ## 

1. On GitHub go to the main page of the repository 
2. Above the list of files click the dropdown Code button 
3. To clone the rrepository using HTTPS under “Clone with HTTPS”, click the floder button  
4. Open terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the local where you want the cloned directory
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied
