USER Story
As a senior user with limited computer skills, required to cocoon at home due to the Covid-19. 
I want to be able to access the signs and symptoms of the condition, what to do if I think I have it as well as be able to watch Mass and religious services through my computer.
I am concerned about staying healthy and maintaining my fitness levels so access to fitness resources would also be of great benefit.
I am not used to using the computer so find it difficult to go to multiple sites to access the information and resources.
